## Getting Started
To use the Trading Strategy Simulator, you'll need to backtest your strategy over a sample size of 100 trades and input the necessary information into the simulator. This includes the number of wins, losses, and breakeven trades, as well as the amount of risk and gain on each trade.

Once you've entered the necessary information, the simulator will run as many cycles of 100 trades as specified, randomly determining the outcome of each trade based on the input parameters. This process will predict the potential profitability of your trading strategy over the long term and show you an account value range.

## Usage
The Trading Strategy Simulator is an excellent tool for gaining insight into the long-term profitability of your strategy. However, it should not be the sole determining factor in making trading decisions. By inputting accurate backtested trade information, traders can obtain reliable predictions on how their strategy may perform over the long term.
